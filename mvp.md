Oh no E18! All the websites that displayed the UK's top 20 songs have simultaneously disappeared! No one knows who is number one - pop groups are rioting and it's carnage in the streets. It's up to you make a simple React app that displays the current UK top 20 songs, and restore order to the pop charts once and for all. You can get the data for this here:

https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/topsongs/limit=20/json

You are required to use a stateless component as part of your app.

The MVP is to request the data, then display the list of songs with each song showing its chart position, title and artist.
